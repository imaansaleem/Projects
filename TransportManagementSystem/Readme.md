## Project 1 of Introduction of Algorithms and Data Structure

The goal is to develop a code in C language that consists in the construction of a management 
system for public transport careers. For this, the system must allow the definition of stations (stops) and 
careers, as well as their consultation. 
 The interaction with the program should occur through a set of lines composed of a letter 
(command) and several arguments depending on the command to be executed. You can assume that all 
input provided will respect the types indicated, for example where a decimal integer value is expected a 
letter will never be entered. The possible commands are listed in the following table and indicate the 
operations to be performed. 

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| q       | terminates the program |
| c       | adds and lists the careers |
| p       | adds and lists stops |
| l       | adds connections |
| i       | lists the intersections between the careers |

## Problem Specification

The goal of the project is to have a public transport career management system. To do this, a set 
of careers are created whose paths correspond to a sequence of connections between stops.
