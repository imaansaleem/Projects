## 2 - Logistic Regression

In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. 
* You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
* For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
* Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.
