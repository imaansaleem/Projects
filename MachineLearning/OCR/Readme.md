## Optical Character Recognition using Naive Bayes
This project demonstrates the implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the Naive Bayes classifier. The goal of this project is to recognize characters from binary images, where each pixel is represented by either a 0 (absence of pixel) or a 1 (presence of pixel).

## Overview
The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process involves recognizing characters or text from images. In this project, we use the Naive Bayes classifier to classify binary images of characters. Each character is represented by a 16x16 binary array, where the presence of a pixel is denoted by 1 and the absence by 0.
