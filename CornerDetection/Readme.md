# Image Transformation

## Task 1
For the provided image s, recover the best projective transformation parameters. You may use MATLAB function ‘getpts(.)’ to record point correspondences in both images.

### Task 1.1
Apply the transformation recovered in part ‘a’ to Image - 1 to get the output image ‘Output - 12’.What could be the problem with this forward mapping? Apply the transformation from part ‘a’ by backward mapping to get the resulting output image ‘Output - 21’.

## Task 2
Implement Corner Detection algorithm discussed in the class. Make your implementation flexible by letting the user choose among different cornerness metrics
