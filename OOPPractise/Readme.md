## Homework: Java OOP Practice and Data Analysis

### Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- Practice reading files, creating functions, and using arrays in Java.
- Apply OOP principles to solve data analysis problems.

### Task
In this homework assignment, you will develop a Java program to read the `student_dataset.csv` file and answer the following questions, each worth 20 points:

1. **Teaching Assistants (TA) Count and Names**
   - Determine the number of Teaching Assistants (TA) and display their names.

2. **Students with GPA > 3.75**
   - Retrieve and display full information of students with a GPA greater than 3.75.

3. **Average Credit Hours for Biology Major**
   - Calculate and display the average credit hours of students majoring in Biology.

4. **Average GPA for B.S. Degree**
   - Calculate and display the average GPA of students with a B.S. degree.

5. **List of Degrees with Total Credit Hours**
   - Generate a list of degrees along with their total credit hours. For example:
     ```
     PhD: 27
     M.S: 92
     ...
     ```

You are expected to decide and use appropriate data structures to efficiently solve these questions. Do not hard code any information; your code should be flexible enough to handle any similar `.csv` file.

### Implementation Guidelines
- Implement the solution using Java's Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- Create classes as needed to represent the entities in your data.
- Store each student record in an object.
- Utilize inheritance where applicable, and explain the benefits in your project report.
- Ensure your code is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- Include appropriate methods to perform the required calculations and generate the output.
